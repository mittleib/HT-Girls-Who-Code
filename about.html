        <p>
          Halfway through her sophomore year, HT student Brynne Mittleider
          noticed the gender disparity of students in her AP Computer Science A
          class. CS classes at HT have always been male-dominated, and she
          realized that this trend needed to change. But, like many across the
          country, few HT girls have any interest in coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brynne had been a member of a Girls Who Code club at her previous
          school. The organization helped her learn to collaborate with others
          and fueled her advancement into recreational coding. She was so
          passionate about her experience that she wanted to create a similar
          opportunity at HT. With the help of club sponsor and HT CS teacher,
          Mrs. Meier, HT's Girls Who Code club was born.

          <span class="code">0</span>'s. We take a well-rounded approach to
          learning computer languages. Our members learn to code games,
          websites, algorithms, and more — for fun, or to change the world.

              build a collective bond that helps reduce fear of failure and

          In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it’s only 22%.
          The percent will continue to decline if we do nothing. We know that
          the biggest drop off of girls in computer science is between the ages
          of 13 and 17.
